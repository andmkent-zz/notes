friction force = mu_s * normal_force
	 normal force = mass_of_obj * g

	 so... mu_s == coefficient of static friction

	 solving for mu_s shows minimum value to hold mass still



* * * * EXAMPLE - box on a hill

Box of mass m on board at angle theta with coefficient of friction mu_k

we'll use cords oriented to be aligned with ramp (y perp and up, x parallel)

gravity is pulling straight down with force mg

normal force acting up, perp. to ramp

Divide gravity into its components
       - one pulling perpendicular and down (mg cos (theta))
       - one pulling down the ramp (mg sin (theta))
       	 - this component is what is accelarating it


	- acceleration == sum of forces divided by mass
	  - sum of forces of normal and perp down force == 0 
	  - x direction = )mg*sin(theta) - friction) / m
	  - friction force = mu_k * normal force
	  - normal force = mg*cos(theta)


ficticious force == force w/ no reasonable Newton's 3rd Law
	   - i.e. Newton's laws use intertial reference frames



* * EXAMPLE

You're driving over a hill. What is your constant force as you go over the top?
 R = 100 m, v=72 km/h, g = 10m/s^2, m = 75 kg

 - R is the radius of the circle that fits the curve at the tip of the hill

 - Forces in free body diagram
   - gravity = downward = mg
   - normal force or contact force = n
   - mg is bigger due to gravity AND centripedal force towards center of hill/circle
   - a = v^2 / R = sum of forces / mass = (mg - n) / m
     => mg - n = mv^2 / R => n = mg - (mv^2) / R
