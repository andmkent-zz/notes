Lab 2
    - simulate UDP over link with 2 nodes
    - call bind/connect etc to set it up
    - when you send packets, it actually goes through
      your simulator
    - rides accross our links from lab 1
    - How does Node know about socket?
      - Node can have function to create socket
      - Or call socket, pass it a ptr to Node instance
      - it MUST go through your link
    - Last schedule on packet path recvfrom(...)
    - just do, when message comes, have them receive it
    - Connect means I only want to hear from / rx from that person

	  - selective ACKs
	    - ACKS only sequence number n
	  - Selective repeat
	    - sender keeps a timer for each packet
